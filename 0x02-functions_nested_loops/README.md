	Nested-Loops

Task 0 -- Write _putchar using _putchar functions

Task 1 -- Print alphabet in lower case use print_alphabet

Task 2 -- print alphabet in lower case 10 times

Task 3 -- Check whether a character is lowercase and return 1

Task 4 -- Check if a character is uppercase and return 1

Tasks 5-- prints the sign of a number.

Task 6 -- computes the absolute value of an integer.

Task 7 -- prints the last digit of a number.

Task 8 -- prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Task 10 -- adds two integers and returns the result.

Task 11 -- print_to_98.c is a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

Task 100 -- prints the n times table, starting with 0.

Task 101 --prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

Task 102 -- prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

Task 103 -- prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci suite under 4000000, followed by a new line.

Task 104 -- prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

Task -- _putchar.c contains the _putchar() function definition.

Task -- main.h is the header Task containing all the function prototypes used in this project.
